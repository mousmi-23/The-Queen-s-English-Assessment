# The-Queen-s-English-Assessment


Problem statement: Create two APIs that’s secured by (JWT), and protected by roles, Users with the role “CREATOR” can create books, API should be “/books” Users with the role “VIEWER” can view books created by them. API should be “/books” users with role “VIEW_ALL” can see all created books API should be “/books” each user can have multiple roles show books that were created 10 minutes ago and more in API “/books?old=1” show books that were created less than 10 minutes ago “/books?new=1”

Expectations: Use a Mongo collection and it works when we switch to any mongodb Keep the connection information in an environment property. Add a logger to log the API calls
